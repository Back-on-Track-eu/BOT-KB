There are several options for storing the information we gather on potential new routes and any associated data.
The simpest option might be :
- a csv file
- table served from github
- a spreadsheet
- or even a copy of the database used for existing services.

## github csv
a flat file of services with columns for useful data could be made

## html table
a table of services similar to a csv could be made which would have the data rendered in a reasonable format for reading or presentation and served from here or the Back on Track website

## spreadsheet
A spreadsheet would offer some of the greatest set of options with a low-tech interface. Either Excel or Google Sheets would work well.

## database
if the database for existing services has already been created and is being used to present high quality visualisations, why not reuse it for potential future services.
