There are various ways of getting night train information.
A model for accessing all transport information has been set up by the EU and consists of each member state being responsible for their own National Access Point.
## National Access Points
The EU has provided details of each of the National Access Points in a table here: https://transport.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-09/its-national-access-points-2023-09-19.pdf
Details for each country are set out below.
## GTFS
The default format for gathering information is GTFS. You can find out more about the format here: https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs
There are also resources on how to work with GTFS here: https://github.com/CUTR-at-USF/awesome-transit#gtfs-realtime-libraries--demo-apps
