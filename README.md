[Back on Track](https://back-on-track.eu/) is an organisation committed to more, better and affordable nighttrains.
This repository has been created to provide information and other resources to:
 1. promote existing night train services
 2. campaign for additional night trains

It's primarily designed for those who are members of the group and will consist of a knowledge base to share information, coded examples, possibly production code as well as a log of new features/enhancements, tasks and issues
