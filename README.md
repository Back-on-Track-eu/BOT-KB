[Back on Track](https://back-on-track.eu/) is an organisation committed to more, better and affordable nighttrains.
This repository has been created to provide information and other resources to:
 1. promote existing night train services
 2. campaign for additional night trains

It's primarily designed for those who are members of the group and will consist of a compilation of 'how-to' pages, coded examples as well as links to other repos for each of the projects that are underway.

### promoting existing night train services
There are various things needed to help promote existing night trains services and they split into three categories
1. gather
   Detail how to get information from different sources for existing night trains and coded examples. The page for this is [here](./gathering_existing_services.md).
3. store
   Information gathered (usually) needs to be stored somewhere and work is underway to bring this about. The page for this is [here](./storing_existing_services.md).
5. present
   The information gathered and stored can then be presented in maps and other useful resources. The page for this is [here](./presenting_existing_services.md).

### campaigning for additional night trains
1. gather
   potential new services from various studies. The page for this is [here](./gathering_future_services.md).
3. store
   Unlike with current live services, a database (or at least a sophisicated DBMS) probably isn't needed. However, the information gathered will need to be stored somewhere. The page for this is [here](./storing_future_services.md).
5. present
   Paps and other resources which help show what services could be provided. The page for this is [here](./presenting_future_services.md).
